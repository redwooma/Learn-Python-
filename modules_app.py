# module : a python file that we can import into our current Python file.

# if a Python that has a bunch of like useful functions or useful variables, or, you know, other things like that, I could take that file
# I could import it into the file I'm currently working on, and I could actually access all of those functions, all of those variables, all the stuff from that external file inside the
# file that I'm currently working on.

# can import useful_tools functions instead of copying and pasting
# importing functionality from external Python file.

# Python has built-in modules and external modules
# external modules are stored in the same folder we installed Python on
